# Cheatsheet project

Project 11 of the Full-Stack Engineer course on Codecademy. The aim is to:

1. To complete this project, you should have completed the codecademy Introduction to HTML course through the HTML tables lesson, and lessons in Learn CSS: Selectors and Visual Rules.


2. Your project should document at least one HTML or CSS topic. In our example project, we documented the tags and attributes used in HTML tables layouts, but you can choose any HTML or CSS topic that you’ve learned so
   far—the sky is the limit!

   Possible topics could be:
    * HTML Tables.
    * Other HTML Tags.
    * CSS Selectors and Specificity.
    * Common CSS Properties.

   If you choose to document HTML tags, open the hint to see how to include HTML tags as a text in your code.


3. Your site uses HTML tables to display the documentation. Be sure to label the columns in your HTML.

   On our example site, we used tables with columns for:
    * The tag or attribute name
    * The actual formatted tag eg. `<table>`
    * A description of what to use the tag for

   You can use these same columns or choose your own.


4. Your site should utilize a custom color scheme. You can use any of the named CSS colors.


5. Your site should use custom styles for any code such as HTML tags like `<h1>` or CSS properties or values like `font-family`. Represent code using a monospace font family and a different background color.
